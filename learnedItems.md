# CORS

* What is CORS?
    * Cross Origin Resource Sharing
        * Restriction in the web broswer that restricts resources from another origin
        * Prevents a request from one origin to another origin 
            * EX: badsite.com, when loaded could try to get your bank account from usbank.com. The browser prevents this with CORS
